Begin work on performing an inventory of hosts in the CoreOS Lab.  This should include the following basic information:
host name
asset number
ip address
all mac addresses of adapters
ipmi mac address
ipmi user name
ipmi password
disk information
cpu information
ram information

# dmidecode | egrep -i 'serial|product' #Asset number
#
To get each one run:
$ hostname -f #Get hostname
$ dmidecode --type system | egrep -i 'System Information' -A 10 | grep Serial #Get asset number
$ ifconfig -a (for now) #ip address and mac adress
$ ipmitool ??? #ipmi things
$ lsblk ??? #disk info
$ lscpu #cpu information
$ dmidecode --type memory #Get ram info

Steps to get information:
1) Start reciever.py on host to receive data (laptop or equivalent), note IP and put in ignition file
2) Boot target machine, use pxe to run inventory ignition file
3) Ignition file will run inventory.sh, and ncat it to the reciever
4) reciever will parse and store the data

TODO:
Write and test ignition files
Finalize all commands
Come up with (or use an already established) format for sending data and/or storing data
Implement reciever-side conversion to that format
