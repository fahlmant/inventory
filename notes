Begin work on performing an inventory of hosts in the CoreOS Lab.  This should include the following basic information:
1) host name - CHECK
2) asset number - I think
3) ip address
4) all mac addresses of adapters - CHECK
5) ipmi mac address
6) ipmi user name
7) ipmi password
8) disk information
9) cpu information
10) ram information

Steps to get information:
1) Start reciever.py on host to receive data (laptop or equivalent), note IP and put in ignition file
2) Boot target machine, use pxe to run inventory ignition file
3) Ignition file will run inventory.sh, and ncat it to the reciever
4) reciever will parse and store the data

TODO:
Write and test ignition files
Finalize all commands
Come up with (or use an already established) format for sending data and/or storing data
Implement reciever-side conversion to that format
